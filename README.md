# Portfolio Website

## Description

The primary goal of this project is to apply HTML and CSS skills learned in the previous modules in order to create a web application from scratch. The secondary goal is to create a portfolio page to showcase skills and talents to employers which I can continue to use and add to as the course progresses. 

I have utilized flexbox, grid, media queries, CSS variables, pseudoelements and basic animations to create a functional, as well as aesthetically interesting, portfolio webpage.  

## Installation

You can open the webpage in your web browser using this URL: https://gyao1487.github.io/portfolio/

## Usage
Features implemented on this webpage:
* Clicking the links in the navigation bar at the top will take you to the respective sections on the webpage
* In the work section, animations are applied when hovering the cursor over the different applications.
* Clicking the cards in the work section will redirect you to the deployed applications.
* Layout is responsive and will adapt to the viewport at various screen sizes to optimize readability and aesthetic.
