## Description

The goal of this project is to improve on the original homepage for Horiseon Social Solution Services, especially the accessibility features and semantic structure. The secondary goal was to learn what it means to refactor code, to implement concepts around HTML and CSS that have been learned during the first week of the bootcamp in a practical/hands-on way, and also to understand accessibility standards for web development. 

The codebase is refactored to improve not only accessibility, but long-term sustainability as well. The webpage functions as the original does, with some improvements in CSS and HTML structure.

## Installation

## Usage

Implemented the following improvements:

* Semantic HTML: Replaced generic <div> elements with semantic elements that better describe the structure and function of each part of the page and removed irrelevant tags.
* Image attributes: Added alt text to <img> elements to increase accessibility especially for users who use assistive technology.
* Heading Order: Made edits to ensure that heading elements are in logical and sequential order
* Page title: Added clear and concise page title to <title> element for increased SEO and accessibility.
* CSS Styling: Consolidated CSS selectors and properties, and organized to follow the semantic structure of HTML.
